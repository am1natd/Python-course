 Around the World Travel Simulation
This project simulates traveling around the world, starting and ending in London, using a dataset of major cities. It answers whether it's possible to complete the journey within 80 days while adhering to given travel conditions.

ðŸ“œ Project Overview
Dataset: Includes coordinates, population, and country for major cities worldwide (source).
Key Conditions:
Travel is always to the 3 nearest cities.
Base travel times:
2 hours for the nearest city,
4 hours for the second nearest,
8 hours for the third nearest.
Additional 2 hours:
If the destination is in a different country.
If the destination city's population exceeds 200,000.
ðŸ§° Technologies Used
Python Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation.
numpy for scientific computations.
networkx for graph creation and analysis.
matplotlib for visualizations.
Graph Representation: Cities are nodes, and edges represent possible travel routes with weights as travel times.
KDTree: Efficiently identifies the 3 nearest neighbors for each city.
ðŸš€ Features
Load and clean dataset.
Build a graph of cities and their travel connections.
Simulate traveling eastward around the world.
Check if the journey can be completed within 80 days (1920 hours).
Visualize travel time distribution.
ðŸ”Ž Key Results
Travel Outcome: Successfully determines if a round trip from London can be achieved within 80 days.
Visualization: Displays the distribution of travel times during the journey.
